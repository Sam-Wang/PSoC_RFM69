## PSoC RFM69: Library to control RFM69 radio modules with Cypress PSoC microcontrollers. ##

### About this repository. ###
* PSoC_RFM69_Library: the library.
* Test: demo/testing projects.
	* PSOC4_RFM: demo/testing for PSoc 4 microcontroller. Tested using a Cypress development kit CY8CKIT-042 PSoC 4 Pioneer Kit.
	* PSOC4M_RFM: demo/testing for PSoc 4 microcontroller. Tested using a Cypress development kit CY8CKIT-044 PSoC 4 M-Series Pioneer Kit.

In development. 
Support for PSoC5LP micros is planned.

### Development environment. ###
* PSoC Creator 3.3 (ARM GCC 4.9 compiler)
* Development kits above mentioned.
* RFM69CW radio modules for 433Mhz (these are the modules i have, library should work for other frequency modules too).

MORE INFO ASAP.
